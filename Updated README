# LASU Law Department Admission Pass Mark Calculator

This script helps calculate the LASU Law Department admission cutoff using:
- JAMB scores (converted to 50%)
- O'Level grades across 5 core subjects
- A final admission decision based on LASU’s defined cutoff rules

## 🔧 How It Works
- Converts JAMB score (out of 400) to a 50% scale
- Assigns grades and points to O'Level subject scores
- Sums JAMB and O'Level scores to determine admission eligibility

## 🏁 Run It
```bash
python main.py
